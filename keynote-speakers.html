                To address the challenges hat online optimization of operational decision-making and control in complex industrial systems cannot be realized, this talk proposes a unified structure and algorithm for integrated operational optimization of decision-making and control, by combining control, optimization, and prediction with AI technology. It also proposed a parameter self-optimizing and self-learning algorithm for operational decision-making and control integrating systems, by combining mechanism analysis with deep learning, and digital twin with reinforcement learning. Based on the tight conjoining of and coordination between the end-edge-cloud collaboration technology of Industrial Internet and PLC control system, an intelligent decision-making and control integrating system based on end-edge-cloud collaboration is developed. The system includes the end serving as an actual operational optimization decision-making and control system at the industrial site, as well as a cloud-edge collaborative parameter self-learning and self-optimizing system in digital space that operates in coordination with the end. The system has been successfully applied in the energy intensive equipment—fused magnesium furnace and achieved remarkable results in the reduction of carbon emission.

              I will discuss some recently discovered brain mechanisms that suggest new brain-inspired AI approaches to planning, problem solving, binding, and compositional computing. This was elucidated in recent collaborations with very talented junior researchers from China. Details can be found in our first publications on these results:

              Explaining Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI)
            </div>
            <div class="fBlod mt20">Abstract</div>
            <div>
              Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) has been a hot topic in recent years. Many papers and books have been published by researchers and practitioners from different communities, addressing different aspects of XAI. However, different papers seem to focus on different definitions of explainability. It is not entirely clear what XAI really means. Firstly, this talk will try to clarify what XAI actually means to different people, at different times and for different purposes. In other words, the talk will first put XAI in a four dimensional space and characterise it in terms of explaining to whom, when, what and how. Secondly, after identifying the most popular XAI technique --- feature attribution explanation (FAE), we will illustrate how evolutionary multi-objective optimisation could be used naturally to enhance explainability of machine learning models. Thirdly, in the opposite direction, we will demonstrate how XAI techniques can be used to enhance the performance of evolutionary algorithms. There are interesting synergies  between XAI and evolutionary computation techniques. Finally, this talk ends with some concluding remarks and future research directions.
